  <p>Some people have lesser days to live on EARTH, some have 1 day but you have to realise that between 0-1 there are infinity of numbers like 0,1; 0.11; 0,12....etc
    but also there  also infinity of numbers between 0-2
    so you have to see that some infinities are bigger than other infinities. Just appreciate everyday that you
    wake up and laugh and just go with the flow.</p>
    <p><b> Laugh with others until you feel like peeing because it might be your last day!!!!!!</b></p>
